# üîç Web Server Log Parser

A C# console app that parses web server logs and generates useful reports. Extracts visitor data, tracks errors, and analyzes traffic patterns from Apache/Nginx access logs.

## What it does

Turns messy log files into readable reports:
- **Traffic analysis** - visitor counts, popular pages, request patterns

- **Performance insights** - peak traffic hours, response sizes, user agents

## Features

- Supports Common Log Format and Extended formats
- Handles malformed entries gracefully
- Normalizes IP addresses and cleans data
- Extracts usernames, referrers, and user agents
- Groups errors by type and frequency
- Shows busiest time periods
